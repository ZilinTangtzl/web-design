            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <div class="grid-container">
                <p>In ancient Chinese history, both the development of social forms and the formation of the state apparatus have changed over time. From the Zhou dynasties to the Ming and Qing dynasties, China has experienced many dynastic changes and territorial changes, and in such a process, the distribution of political power has changed along with the system. The official system, as a particularly important part of ancient Chinese politics, also evolved and changed. No matter it is the mutual checks and balances between the power of the chancellor and the monarch from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the increasing use of the supervision system as a ruling tool of the monarch, or the gradual loss of independence of local governments and their transfer into areas under the direct jurisdiction of the central government. </p>

                <p>The most significant change reflects in these processes was the gradual centralization of power, with the decentralized power finally being completely in the hands of the central government and the monarch. These changes reflected the needs of the rulers and the political games at the top class. In general, the trend  of the evolution of central power in ancient China was the continuous strengthening of monarchical power and the continuous weakening of local power and official authority. To a certain extent, monarchs gradually gained their absolute power.</p>

                    <p>In ancient China, the power of emperor, which is called the monarchical power was the supreme authority held by the emperor, who ruled the country and claimed to be the representative of Heaven. Through addressing themselves as "Son of Heaven", they gained the divine right to maintain control over a vast territory of China, as their decisions and decrees were considered to be representing the will of the heavenly court.</p>

                    <p>The prime minister, was another prominent figure in ancient China's politics and power dynamics. As the highest-ranking official in the imperial court, the prime minister served as the emperor's chief advisor, and was responsible for executing policies, overseeing administration, and managing state affairs. They are often considered to be "under one person and above all others". With the balance of power varying over time, the power struggle between the emperor and the prime minister has lasted a long period of time, and would deeply effected the country. In some periods, the prime minister held significant power and could even overshadow the emperor, as a result, there were even cases is history when the bureaucratic group abolished the emperor and then chose another new one. However, as the history progressed, emperors gradually consolidated their supreme power and reduced the influence of the prime minister.</p>

                    <p>In ancient China, the feudal aristocracy power was the power wielded by nobles, who were granted land and titles by the emperor in exchange for their loyalty and military support. These vassal lords administered their territories independently, owned armies, could levy taxes, and enforced their own laws within their domains. This meant that the central government was somewhat decentralized and had limited control over the vassal states, with local nobles responsible for managing the order of their own lands Such a system also led to conflicts and power struggles among the various aristocratic families, and even to chaos throughout the country as they tried to expand their influence and secure their place in politics.</p>
