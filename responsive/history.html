                            <p>At first, before the concept of kingship emerged, the abdication system1 existed briefly as a system of power transmission and handover. The idea of the abdication system was to encourage that power would be held by competent and moral people, rather than concentrating power in a fixed number of families. At that time, people existed more like tribes than feudal states, and power was not yet firmly in the hands of a few individuals.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p2">
                            <p>Later, in 2070-1600 B.C., the hereditary system replaced the abdication system and the transfer of power was limited by blood ties, which meant the emergence of kingship or monarchy. During this period, state apparatuses such as armies, prisons, penalties... appeared as tools to enforce the ruling power, and their appearance reflected the gradual formation of kingship. Power gradually shifted from democratic to centralized.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="paragraph p3">
                            <p>However, the trend toward centralization of power was still in its beginning stages during this period, and overall there was still a great deal of decentralization of power. During the Shang dynasty, a system of internal and external subordination system2 emerged that distinguished between the areas directly ruled by the Shang dynasty and other vassal states. Although these vassal states were required to fulfill their tribute obligations to the Shang, they remained states with a high degree of autonomy that retained their original social structure. And Shang had limited control over these vassal states. Obviously, at this time, even though kingship had emerged, power was still not fully concentrated in the hands of the central dynastic monarchs, and local power remained strong.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p4">
                            <p>During the Zhou Dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty adopted some measures to strengthen monarchical power and control localities, such as the feudal system. The monarch of the  Zhou dynasty was recognized by the vassal kings as the "common lord of the world", i.e., the supreme ruler of the dynasty's sphere of influence. This system made the status relationship between monarchs and officials and lords more and more obvious. However, the official and feudal system at this time allowed vassal states to have their own armed forces, to collect taxes in their own territories, and to distribute land to their subordinates in their own territories. In other words, the vassal states still had a great deal of autonomy during this period. And even though the status of vassal king was granted by the Zhou dynasty, Chinese political power was still decentralized in various regions. Such fragmented power also set the stage for the collapse of the patriarchal feudal system during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p5">
                            <p>At the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, the relationship between the feudal states and the Zhou Dynasty was closer, but because of the greater power of the land rulers and the slow dissemination of information due to inconvenient transportation, the so-called feudal system was only a loose alliance of one during this period, and as the system operated, independent forces emerged.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p6">
                            <p>The official formation of absolute monarchy was in the period of Qin Dynasty. The formation of such system was influenced by the schools of thought in pre-Qin period, during which philosophers and politicians proposed and highly praised the idea of “reverence for the one king”. For example, Mencius, one of the most famous and influential philosophers in Chinese history, once claimed that “There cannot be two kings in a country”. Such idea existed to call on the concentration, and this is due to the chaos and competition among  vassal states had been caused by the decentralization of power and central government lacked of forcing power . Therefore, such thought helped Qin to clean the barriers on the way to centralized unification. Qin Shi Huang learned from the lessons of the feudal system during the Zhou Dynasty and made institutional changes, while his actions strengthened centralized power and limited the power of officials.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p7">
                            <p>During the Han Dynasty, the feudal states grew stronger and the possibility of decentralization of power once again emerged. The "Rebellion of the Seven Kingdoms of Wu and Chu" put the centralization of power at risk. Emperor Wu then introduced the "pushing enlightenment order", which gradually broke up the fragmentation of power of the feudal states to the central government. At the same time, the Han dynasty also imposed restrictions and limitations on people's thinking, which was also an act of strengthening the power of the monarch.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p8">
                            <p>During the Sui and Tang dynasties, the political system and the official system further developed and evolved. Prior to this time, the feudal dynasties' solutions to the problem of decentralization had focused on limiting local power, while the Sui and Tang dynasties began to further limit the power of officials and the nobility. At this time, officials' powers began to check and balance each other. As the power of the nobility was restricted, the monarch took the power to select officials into his pocket, and with the expansion of the monarch's power, the concentration of political power in China rose once again.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="paragraph p9">
                            <p>The process above shows that, after the establishment of the absolute monarchy by the Qin dynasty, in the following dynasties, the political power in China tended to be centralized, while the power in the central government tended to be centralized to the monarch.</p>
