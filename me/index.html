                    <p>I don't really have much <a href="#hobbies">hobbies</a>. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in indoor activities. Watching movies and reading books are my go-to pastimes, and I find them to be a great way to relax and unwind. I'm not particularly interested in watching or reading what is considered "meaningful" or "classic" content. Instead, I see these activities as enjoyable leisure pursuits rather than sources of education.</p>

                        <p>Technically, "my pets" may not be a part of me, but it's important to me because I care more about <a href="pets.html">my pets</a> than my so-called hobbies.</p>
                        <p>I had a rabbit when I was a kid, but only as a substitute because I wasn't allowed to have a cat or a dog by my parents. But soon, on a trip, I found out I was allergic to it, so I had to give the rabbit to my grandmother to keep.</p>
                        <p>My favorite animals were dogs, especially German Shepherds. During my high school years, I finally got my wish to have a pet dog. However, instead of allowing me to choose the dog, my parents picked the breed of dog: a Belgian Malinois. So I ended up not being able to touch a German Shepherd.</p>
                        <p>I also have a cat at home. He is an orange and white Chinese garden cat named "Fish". Initially, we wanted him to help with the mice and bugs in the house, and that worked. However, a new problem emerged. This cat always brought a lot of other cats back to our yard, and then we had to prepare cat food for many cats every day.</p>
