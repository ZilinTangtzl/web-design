                    </div>

                    <article class="relationship-text">
                        <div class="paragraph1">
                        <p data-language="en">On the basis of these checks and balances on the monarchy from the Prime Minister power, the successive monarchs are obviously committed to strengthening their  own absolute power, so they will choose to gradually suppress and disperse the Prime Minister power. The relationship between the monarchical power and the prime minister power evolved along the principle of “Superior to the monarch and inferior to the minister”. According to the relatively agreed research conclusion of the academic circles, we can say that a history of the evolution of the Prime Minister system in China is the history of the monarchy’s continuous control over the prime minister’s power. </p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">在对相权进行的制约和平衡的基础上，历代的君主显然致力于强化自己的绝对权力，所以他们会选择逐步压制和分散宰相权力。君权与相权的关系沿着 "君尊臣卑 "不断演变。根据学术界相对一致的研究结论，我们可以说，一部中国宰相制度的演变史，就是君主对宰相权力不断控制的历史。</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="paragraph2">
                        <p data-language="en">It can be seen from this, the birth of the Prime Minister Power is actually derived from the needs of the monarch. Monarchical power is absolute and ultimate, while ministerial power is derivative and comes directly from the emperor. In other words, there is a difference between the Monarchical power and the prime minister power. But this obviously does not mean that the power of the prime minister is completely controlled by the monarch, because in fact, throughout history, the power of the Prime Minister has for a long time played the decentralization of power, so that the monarch is not completely arbitrary. Whether it is the actual power to appoint local officials held by Cao Cao, the prime minister who held power at the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, or the “Langya Wang clan and the royal family jointly owned the world”. Print]in the Eastern Jin dynasty, it shows that the power of the monarch once was insufficient, to a certain extent, power can be “stolen” by officials. It is worth noting that one of the most famous prime ministers in Chinese history, Zhang Juzheng, also said, “I am not the prime minister, I am the Regent”.</p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">由此可见，相权的诞生实际上源于君权的需要。君主的权力是绝对的、终极的，而大臣的权力是派生的，直接来自皇帝。换句话说，君权和相权之间是存在差异的。但这显然并不意味着宰相的权力完全受制于君主，因为事实上，在历史上，宰相的权力在很长一段时间内起到了分权的作用，使君主并非完全独断专行。无论是东汉末年掌权的丞相曹操所掌握的地方官员的实际任命权，还是东晋时期的"王与马，共天下"，都表明了君主权力曾经存在不足的情形，在一定程度上，权力可以被官员 "窃取"。值得注意的是，中国历史上最有名的宰相之一张居正也说过："吾非相,乃摄也“。</p>

                    <article class="constrait-text">
                        <div class="paragraph3">
                        <p data-language="en">As an important political power in ancient Chinese history, Prime Minister Power once played the role of gaming and restricting each other with imperial power to a certain extent, the gradual weakening of the Prime Minister Power until it was finally abolished It meant that the constraints on the monarchy had almost disappeared, and political power was thus largely in the hands of the individual monarch. Before discussing the evolution of the monarch power and the prime minister power, we first need to clarify the definition of these two kinds of powers. “Huang Di(皇帝)(Emperor)”was originally a generic term for “San Huang Wu Di(Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors)” in the Chinese context. Qin Shi Huang, who created the Qin dynasty as a unified dynasty, called himself “Huang Di(Emperor)”,  and the Emperor thus became the name of supreme ruler of China. The power of the emperor, it mainly includes the personnel appointment power, the military power, and the financial power. The Prime Minister’s power of taking charge of the state administration originated from the spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period. Since then, the prime minister has been transformed from a ceremonial tutor into a political position with executive power for the monarch. The reason for this change is the need to assist the monarch in the management of state affairs, but also because the monarch needs to use the Prime Minister power as a tool to resist the power of the aristocracy. According to Records of the Historian, “The Prime Minister’s duties, up to assist the emperor to regulate yin and yang, to comply with the four seasons, down to the realization of the essence of all things, externally suppress the surrounding regimes and vassals, internally close to ordinary people, and ensure all the officials can do their duty”. </p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">相权作为中国古代历史上的重要政治力量，曾经在一定程度上发挥了与皇权相互制约的作用，但其逐渐衰弱直至最终被废除，意味着对君主的制约几乎消失殆尽，政治权力也因此大量集中于君主手中，在讨论君主权力和相权演变之前，首先需要明确这两种权力的定义。皇帝一词最初是指中国历史上的“三皇五帝”的泛称。创立统一王朝的秦始皇自封为“皇帝”，皇帝因此成为中国的最高统治者名称。皇帝的权力主要包括人事任免权、军权和财权等。相权的掌控国家事务的权力起源于春秋战国时期。相权作为负责国家行政管理的职位源于春秋战国时期，由礼官逐渐转变为具有君主执行权的政治职位。这种变化的原因既是为了协助君主管理国家事务，也是因为君主需要将相权作为工具来抵御贵族的势力。据《史记》记载，“宰相者，上佐天子理阴阳，顺四时，下育万物之宜，外镇抚四夷诸侯，内亲附百姓，使卿大夫各得任其职焉”。</p>
                        </div>


                        <div class="paragraph4">
                        <p data-language="en">In the Tang dynasty, when the power of the prime minister was divided into three parts by the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, the checks and balances of the power of the prime minister still existed. Mr.QianMu once mentioned that in the Tang dynasty,“Orders issued directly by the emperor, without the seal of the Zhongshu or Menxia Department, were considered illegal at the time and could not be recognized by the organs at the following levels. Therefore, “Without the Fengge(凤阁 another name of Shangshu) and Luantai(鸾台 another name of Zhongshu), how can it be a order”. This still means that all the emperor’s commands must pass through the Zhongshu and Menxia departments. Of course, such checks and balances can only be regarded as a theoretical level of checks and balances, because by the Tang dynasty, the prime minister has been significantly weakened. Therefore, after the prime minister Yizhi Liu said such words as “Without the Fengge (Shangshu) and Luantai (Zhongshu) , how can it be a order”, he instead provoked Wu Zetian and was given death by Wu Zetian. </p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">即使在唐代，当宰相的权力被三司六部制分割成三部分时，对宰相权力的制衡仍然存在。钱穆先生曾提到，在唐代，"皇帝直接发布的命令，如果没有中书省或门下省的印章，在当时被认为是非法的，不能被以下各级机关所承认。因此，"没有凤阁（尚书的另一个名称）和鸾台（中书的另一个名称），怎么可能是命令"。这仍然意味着，皇帝的所有命令都必须经过中书和门下的部门。当然，这种制衡只能算是理论层面的制衡，因为到了唐代，宰相的地位已经大大削弱。因此，当宰相刘懿之说出"不经凤阁鸾台,何名为敕"这样的话后，激怒了武则天，并被武则天赐死。</p>
                        </div>

                    <!-- <article class="constrait-text1"> -->
                        <div class="paragraph5">
                        <p data-language="en">In the Western Han dynasty, the main way for the monarch to restrain the prime minister and realize the centralization of power was to control the outer court prime minister by the inner court, which was controlled by the monarch’s trusted followers, while in the Eastern Han dynasty, the three councillors was controlled by the Shangshutai (a central authorities department), in the Tang Dynasty, the Prime Minister was deprived of his powers by means of a Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which divided the powers of the prime minister into three parts. In the Song dynasty, the three secretaries and the Privy Council were set up to separate the powers of the Prime Minister. In the Ming dynasty, the prime minister was publicly abolished, and deliberately obscure the role and identity of the cabinet.</p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">在西汉时期，君主约束宰相、实现中央集权的主要方式是通过内廷控制外廷宰相，而内廷宰相则由君主的亲信控制；在东汉时期，三司使由尚书台（中央机关部门）控制；在唐朝，通过三司六部制剥夺了宰相的权力，将宰相的权力分为三部分。在宋朝，设立三司和枢密院，将宰相的权力分开。在明朝，宰相被公开废除，并刻意模糊了内阁的作用和身份。</p>
                        </div>
                        

                        <div class="paragraph6">
                        <p data-language="en">Finally, in the Qing dynasty, there’s a department called Military Affair were set above cabinet, and the Military Affair was directly responsible to the emperor and was completely controlled by the emperor, which was equivalent to the emperor's private secretary. By this time, with the disappearance of the prime minister's power, political power was almost completely concentrated on the emperor. As institutions change, the number of prime ministers also changed. In the early days of the Han dynasty, there was usually only one prime minister, but later there were more and more prime ministers(17 in Emperor Xuan of Tang Dynasty) , and the posts became more and more irregular, the Assistant Administrator（参知政事）has also been created to decentralize the power. It is also a well-known phenomenon that before the Song dynasty, the prime minister maintained the tradition of “Sitting and talking about Tao”. He could sit and talk about politics with the emperor, and from the Song dynasty , he could only “Stand and report”. All this shows that the relationship between the superior and the subordinate is constantly strengthening.</p>
                        <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">最后，在清朝，有一个叫军机处的部门被设置在内阁之上，而军机处直接对皇帝负责，完全由皇帝控制，相当于皇帝的私人秘书。至此，随着宰相权力的消失，政治权力几乎完全集中在皇帝身上。随着体制的变化，宰相的数量也在变化。在汉朝初期，通常只有一个宰相，但后来宰相越来越多（唐玄宗时有17个），职位也越来越不固定，助理行政官（参知政事）也被设立，以分散权力。还有一个众所周知的现象是，在宋朝以前，宰相保持着 "坐而论道 "的传统。他可以与皇帝坐而论道，而从宋代开始，他只能 "立而报之"。这一切都表明，上级和下级之间的关系在不断加强。</p>

                <h2 data-language="en">Supervision System</h2>
                <h2 data-language="zh" style="display:none;">监察制度</h2>
                <article>
                    <p data-language="en">Another factor that had an essential impact on the power distribution in official and political system is the central supervision which keeps being strengthening throughout the history. The supervision system started early from the Warring states time. As a system created with the objective of supervise officials and guarantee the stable ruling of rulers, the supervision system played the role of helping emperor to restrict bureaucratic power and prevent the emergence of power decentralization. On the basis of the supervision system inherited from the previous dynasties, the emperors sought to reduce the restriction and supervision of their own imperial power by strengthening the restriction on the power of others. Therefore, as emperors from different dynasties gradually strengthens the supervision upon local powers and officials’ powers, the space left for officials, headed by the prime minister, was compressed hugely. In order to explore the impact of the development of the supervision system on the political power, we first need to understand the definition and specific powers of the supervision system.  The supervision system was a special "quasi-judicial" system of state supervision established in ancient China, which is a feudal state to monitor government officials, serve the interests of the state and the emperor, maintain the established ruling order, and ensure the normal functioning of the state machinery. </p>
                    <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">另一个对官方和政治体系中的权力分配有重要影响的因素是中央监督，它在历史上一直在加强。监察制度早在战国时期就开始了。作为一种以监督官员、保证统治者稳定统治为目的的制度，监察制度起到了帮助皇帝限制官僚权力、防止权力分散的作用。在继承前朝监察制度的基础上，皇帝们试图通过加强对他人权力的限制来减少对自己皇权的限制和监督。因此，随着不同朝代的皇帝逐渐加强对地方权力和官员权力的监督，留给以宰相为首的官员的空间被大大压缩。为了探讨监察制度的发展对政治权力的影响，我们首先需要了解监察制度的定义和具体权力。  监察制度是中国古代封建国家为监督政府官员，为国家和皇帝的利益服务，维护既定的统治秩序，保证国家机器的正常运转而建立的一种特殊的 "准司法 "国家监察制度。</p>

                    <p data-language="en">While considering the power distribution, there’s an famous saying of Montesquieu: “Constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go”. In Montesquieu’s theory, such issue of abuse power can be solved by the checks and balance system which regulate power by another power. However, the supervision system in ancient China, was indeed used for regulating abuse power, but only on officials power and local power. Another major feature of the supervision system was its independent functioning mechanism and dependence on the imperial power. From the central government (the monarch) to the various levels of the inspectorates, a relatively independent system was formed with a single vertical line, with the inspectorates serving the monarch directly and relatively separate from executive departments, and the inspectors relatively separate from the government bureaucrats.</p>
                    <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">在考虑权力分配时，孟德斯鸠有一句名言："不断的经验告诉我们，每一个被赋予权力的人都有可能滥用权力，并将其权力发挥到极致"。在孟德斯鸠的理论中，这种滥用权力的问题可以通过制衡制度来解决，即由另一种权力来调节权力。然而，中国古代的监察制度确实是用来规范滥用权力的，但只是针对官员权力和地方权力。监察制度的另一个主要特点是其独立的运作机制和对皇权的依赖性。从中央政府（君主）到各级监察院，形成了一个相对独立的系统，形成了一条垂直线，监察院直接为君主服务，与行政部门相对分离，监察人员与政府官僚相对分离。</p>

            <div class="long-text">
                <h2 data-language="en">Expostulation System</h2>
                <h2 data-language="zh" style="display:none;">谏言制度</h2>
                <article>
                    <p data-language="en">Since there existed a system of supervision to limit the power of bureaucrats, it is worth mentioning that an institution for judging  and criticizing the monarch's decisions also existed at one time in Chinese history, namely the expostulation system. The derivation of the word "expostulation" in Chinese means "to advise the emperor when he makes a wrong choice, to disagree with the absolute power of the monarch". Thus, the expostulation system, as the name implies, is a system that allows one to give opinions and even criticize the monarch's actions and decisions. Both the expostulation system and the supervision system were organs that played a supervisory role in ancient Chinese politics; however, the limitations of the expostulation system were considerable because it was not based on another kind of power that could be played with monarchical power, but on some moral norms and principles that had long been enunciated by Confucian doctrine and were accepted by the monarch only when they were approved by an enlightened ruler. </p>
                    <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">既然存在着限制官僚权力的监督制度，那么值得一提的是，在中国历史上也曾一度存在着对君主决策进行评判和批评的机构，即谏言制度。谏言 "一词在中文中的引申含义是 "在皇帝做出错误选择时向他提出建议，不同意君主的绝对权力"。因此，谏言制度，顾名思义，是一种允许人们对君主的行为和决定提出意见，甚至批评的制度。劝谏制度和监督制度都是在中国古代政治中发挥监督作用的机关；然而，劝谏制度的局限性是相当大的，因为它不是建立在另一种可以与君主权力博弈的基础上，而是建立在儒家学说早已阐明的一些道德规范和原则上，只有在得到开明君主的认可后，才能被君主接受。</p>

                    <p data-language="en">The expostulation system is not compulsory, cannot really limit the absolute power of the monarch, and cannot even be regarded as "freedom of speech" in the concept of democracy. However, the supervision system, which was dependent on the monarch's power and served him directly, had the support of the monarch's power and was therefore able to truly restrain the power of the prime minister and bureaucrats who once decentralized the monarch's power. What’s more, the development trend of the supervision system and expostulation system were quite different. The supervision system has been continuously improved and strengthened, seeking to limit any power outside monarchy in the largest extent, while the expostulation system has been gradually shelved since the Yuan dynasty, and even completely lost its role in the Ming and Qing Dynasty. Such a phenomenon lead to the result that the monarchical power expand with few restriction, while other organs that used to have power was continuously weakened. </p>
                    <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">谏言制度不是强制性的，不能真正限制君主的绝对权力，甚至不能被视为民主概念中的 "言论自由"。但是，依附于君主权力、直接为君主服务的监察制度却有君主权力的支持，因此能够真正约束曾经分散君主权力的宰相和官僚的权力。更为重要的是，监督制度和征询意见制度的发展趋势截然不同。监察制度不断完善和加强，力求在最大程度上限制君主以外的任何权力，而奏折制度自元代以来逐渐被搁置，到了明清时期甚至完全失去了作用。这种现象导致的结果是，君主权力在几乎没有限制的情况下扩张，而其他曾经拥有权力的机关却不断被削弱。</p>

                <p data-language="en">In a word, from the Han dynasty to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the prime ministers were developed by the Emperor’s private ministers. If they had too much power, they would be banned and replaced by a new body of prime ministers developed around the emperor. With the imperial power as the center, the Prime Minister of China presents a cycle of replace and reproduction state. The monarchical power is expanding, and there is less and less space in the system remained for the Prime minister power. All these are due to the idea of the “Family country”[ Sheng, Dai. The Book of Rites], to maintain the absolute power of the monarch. In Zhang Taiyan’s words, it was because the emperor, “Appreciate those closest to him, hated those whose prestige was greater than that of the sovereign.”</p>
                <p data-language="zh" style="display:none;">总而言之，从汉代到明清时期，宰相大多由皇帝的私人大臣发展而来。如果他们的权力过大，就会被废止，由围绕皇帝发展的新的相权机构取代。以皇权为中心，中国的宰相呈现出一个周期性的更替和再生状态。皇权不断扩张，体系中给宰相权力留下的空间越来越少。这一切为了维护“家天下”的观念，以维持君主的绝对权力。用章太炎的话说，这是因为皇帝"赏识最亲近的人，憎恨威望大于君主的人"。</p>
