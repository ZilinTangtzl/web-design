                    <p>Black Bean is a male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Shepherd">Belgian Malinois</a>. We named him this way because of his eyes, which looked like two shiny black beans when he was a puppy. As a Belgian Malinois, he is a medium-sized breed with an energetic and boisterous personality, which can be intimidating to some people. At first, I was also a little worried because picking him was a decision made by my mom. But soon I realized that he is really cute and energetic. We have to wake up early every day to prepare his food and take him for a walk every morning, or he will make noises to remind us. It's important to put a muzzle on Black Bean when taking him for a walk, as some people are afraid of dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In the evenings, we play games like Frisbee and tug-of-war with him to tire him out so he doesn't become too active and destructive.

                    <p>Meet my furry companion, Little Fish. Little Fish is a Chinese Garden cat and was initially thought to be a female, until we took him to the vet for his shots and found out he was a male. Despite his wilful and wilful tough demeanor as a kitten, pushing his siblings away when it was mealtime, and he often jumps onto my lap and demands to be petted, and even gives me a tap (with his paw, not claws extended) if I forget. Despite this, it's quite surprising that he has such a friendly relationship with other cats and often has different cats coming to visit him or even play with him in the yard. We often see different cats, even a few at a time, running into our yard to play with Little Fish. As a result, we had to provide a little cat house and a pile of cat food in our yard for Little Fish's feline friends.</p>
